# Movie-Application
This Movie App used OMDB's api to search for movie's they may be interested in.
First the User will create an account on the main screen of the App or if they already have an account they simply just login.
The Login system uses Google's Firebase in order to maintain a proper authentication system.
Once the user is logged in they simply need to search for the movie's name and hit submit.
Then the movie along with its description should appear.
